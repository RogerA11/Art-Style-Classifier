# Art-Style-Classifier

This repository contains an art style classifier built using a pretrained neural network. The classifier can identify and categorize art into three groups: Cubism, Surrealism, and Abstract Expressionism.

## Overview

In this solo project, I:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Curated a dataset of around 200 images per art style type from DuckDuckGo image search.

2. **Model Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuned a pretrained neural network to recognize distinct features for each art style type.

3. **Performance Evaluation**: Assessed the classifier's accuracy and generalization on new images.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/RogerA11/Art-Style-Classifier-Model.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository:
```
cd Art-Style-Classifier-Model
```

3. Open and run `artstyleclassifier.ipynb` to explore the project details.
